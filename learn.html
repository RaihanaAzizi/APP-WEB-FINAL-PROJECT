        <h1>Why Education Matters?</h1>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>Education is a fundamental human right, but for girls in Afghanistan,it is often seen as a privilege. Despite the many obstacles they face, education has the power to transform the lives of Afghan girls,their families, and the entire nation. Here's why it matters:</p>

            <p><strong>2: Empowerment and Independence</strong></p>
            <p>Education empowers girls by giving them the skills and knowledge to take control of their lives.It enables them to make informed decisions, break free from the cycle of poverty, and contribute to their communities. An educated girl is more likely to delay marriage, have fewer and healthier children, and invest in their education,creating a positive cycle of empowerment.</p>

            <p><strong>2: Economic Growth</strong></p>
            <p>When girls are educated,they are more likely to join the workforce and contribute to the economy. Studies have shown that countries with higher literacy rates among women experience greater economic growth. In Afghanistan, where the economy faces numerous challenges, educating girls could be a key to unlocking untapped potential.</p>

            <p><strong>3: Social and Political Impact</strong></p>
            <p>Education fosters critical thinking and awareness of rights,enabling women to participate in social and political spheres. Afghanistan has witnessed courageous women, such as Malalai of Maiwand and others, who became symbols of resistance and empowerment. Educated girls are more likely to become leaders, advocates,and change-makers in their communities.</p>

            <p><strong>4: Improved Health and Well-being</strong></p>
            <p>Educated women are better equipped to take care of their health and that of their families. They are more likely to understand the importance of nutrition, hygiene, and vaccinations, leading to healthier communities.
            Moreover,education reduces maternal and child mortality rates.</p>

            <h1>A Brief History of Education for Girls in Afghanistan</h1>

            <p><strong>For Afghan girls has been both progress and setbacks over the decades:</strong></p>

            <div class="history">
                <p><strong>Pre-1970s: </strong>Girls' education was extremely limited, especially in rural areas. However, urban regions like Kabul saw some progress, with girls attending schools and uneversities. The few girls who did recieve education were typically from wealthy or politically connected families living in major cities such as Kabul. These girls were often taught in private schools or at home by tutors, and their education was usually focused on subjects like basic literacy and domestic skills rather than academic disciplines. The government did take some early steps toward girls' education in the 20th century. In general, before the 1970s, education for girls was a privilege and not a widespread reality, with many barriers to access in both rural and even some urban areas.</p>

            <div class="history">
                <p><strong>1970-1980: </strong>During the Soviet era, efforts were made to modernize education, and many girls gained access to schools. However, this was often met with resistance in consernative areas. In 1970s, education for girls in Afghanistan was a topic of gradual progress and challenges. During the earlt parts of the decade, the country saw some improvements in women's rights and education, particularly in urban areas. The government under King Zahir Shah, introduced reforms that promoted educations for girls, and schools for girls were opened in cities like Kabul. Overall, the 1970s were a time of hope for girls' education in Afghanistan, but the progress was uneven, and challenges remained due to cultural traditions and political instability.</p>

            <div class="history">
                <p><strong>1990s: </strong>The rise of the Taliban led to one of the darkest periods for girls' education. Girls were banned from attending schools, and women were prohibited from working. When Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996, they imposed strict interpretations of Islamic law, which included severse restrictions on women's rights, including their right to education. Many female teachers were forced to stop working and in rural areas, girls had little to no access to education.In summary, the 1990s were a devastating decade for girls' education in Afghanistan, with the country experiencing widespread destruction of educational infrastructure and severe restrictions on female education, particularly under the Taliban regime.</p>

            <div class="history">
                <p><strong>2001-2021: </strong>After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, there was significant progress. Millions of girls returned to school, and women began to join the workforce in greater numbers. Initiatives by the government and NGOs helped rebuild the education system. The number of girls enrolled in school rose dramatically, and many girls who have been deprived of educations for years were able to attend classes again! By 2010, millions of girls were attending schools, all over the country. However, despite these gains, education for girls in rural areas remined a challenge. Totally, from 2001 to 2021, there were significant achievements in girls' education. The situation took a dramatic turn in 2021, when the Taliban regained control of the country, leading to the closure of girls' schools in many areas.</p>

            <div class="history">
                <p><strong>Past 2021: </strong>Recent political changes have once again placed restrictions on girls' education, with secondary and higher education being denied to many. In March 2022, schools briefly reopened for girls in some areas but were quickly closed again, leaving millions of girls without access to education beyond primary school. This ban has profoundly affected Afghan society. Many girls now faci early marriages as families shift financial burdens, and the future pipeline of educated women in professions like teaching, medicine, and civil service is at risk of drying up.  Despite this, Afghan women and girls continue to fight for their right to education. They rise, they fight, and they thrive. Afghan women and girls are unstoppable!!!</p>

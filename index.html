                <h2>We Still Dream!!! In Afghanistan, the voice of countless girls seeking education remain silent. Despite their dreams and aspirations, these young minds are often denied the opportunity to learn, leaving them in the shadows of unfulfilled potential. Education is not just a right, but a key to empowerment, and every girl's voice deserves to be heard. The silence surrounding their education is a cry for change that cannot be ignored! For when we lift their voices, we build a brighter future for al</h2>

                <h1>Salaam!!! üëã Welcome to one of my very first websites!</h1>
                <p>My name is Raihana Azizi, an 18-year-old girl living in the north of Afghanistan. I was a 10th grade student when schools were closed for girls, but that did not extinguish my passion for learning.</p>
                <p>Today, I pursue education with unwavering determination and dedicate myself to spreading hope among Afghan girls. </p>
                <p>I believe in the power of knowledge to change lives, and through Silent Voice, I aim to amplify the unread stories of Afghan girls and inspire hope. I am determined to pursue knowledge and create a platform where every girl can share her journey, find strength, and believe in the power of her voice.</p>
                <p>Together, we can transform silence into a force for change!</p>
